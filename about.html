        <p>Until now I could describe my 30 years life in many ways. As professional classical musician. As a husband and father of two lovely boys. As a man who at age of 27 left his home country for good to start a new, better life in place a thousand miles away. As a professional who, in seven years, changed his career path five times starting from worlds famous concert halls, going through world most famous fast food restaurant(I'm lovin' it) and best known German discount retailer shops (Just a Lidl further...). Considering my sons growing apetite it turn out to be nessesary to find a new, better paid job so I got an LGV licence and for over a year I've been causing irreversible damage to our planet each and every day. All that time when I was working 60 hours a week I was looking for an opportunity to get a proper job and now this opportunity arise. I became _nology student with high hopes that this will be my first step on my road to professional succes. See you on the other side!</p>
